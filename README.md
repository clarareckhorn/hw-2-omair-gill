# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw-2-omair-gill/main?urlpath=lab/tree/LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb)

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

This repository is based on the original [LIGO Open Science Center Tutorial](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial) and was restructured as part of Homework 2 for this class. The project demonstrates how to organize research code into a reproducible and shareable format using modern data science tools. The goal of this assignment is to convert the original LIGO tutorial into a well-structured research package. The supporting Python script `readligo.py` has been moved into a new package folder called `ligotools`, making it importable as `from ligotools import readligo as rl`. A Conda environment named `ligo`, defined in the `environment.yml` file, ensures that all required dependencies are installed correctly and consistently across systems.

The Binder link above allows anyone to open the repository in JupyterLab directly, with the `LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb` notebook already preloaded and ready to run. This ensures that the full analysis can be easily executed online without additional steps.

The repository also includes the key LIGO data files required for the analysis: `BBH_events_v3.json`, `GW150914_4_template.hdf5`, `H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5`, and `L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5`. The main Git tags used throughout this assignment are `repo-basic`, `ligotools-pkg`, `conda-env`, and `binder`, marking the main development milestones.
